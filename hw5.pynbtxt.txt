Exercise 1 - Testing your knowledge of files
Answer the below questions
In your own words, describe what a file is?
A file is an object on a computer that stores data, information, settings, or commands used with a computer program. In a graphical user interface such as Microsoft Windows, files display as icons that relate to the program that opens the file.

Why is it important to close a file after we are done using it? 

It can slow down your program. Too many things open, and more used space in the RAM, will impact performance.
For the most part, many changes to files in python do not go into effect until after the file is closed, so if your script edits, leaves open,
and reads a file, it won't see the edits, 
run in to limits of how many files you can have open.


Exercise 2 - Write to a file
Write a python program to write the below lines to a file
Name, Age, Gender, Profession
Harry, 23, Male, Software Engineer
Sam, 25, Male, Lawyer
Lisa, 29, Female, Computer Scientist
Mary, 22, Female, Doctor
Below are a set of recommended steps to accomplish this
open a file in write mode. This will return a handle to the file
use the write method to write each line to the file using the file handle returned in the open call
close the file when done
Once done, go to the folder where the file is and open it to make sure that this is written.
Refer to class exercises especially "In [22]" in https://github.com/cis024c/fall2017classwork/blob/master/week5/working_with_files.ipynb

def get_ids_for_age_intervall(start_age, end_age, ages):
       "get indexes for members in a given age intervall"
    ids = []
    for i, age in  enumerate(ages):
        if (start_age<=age) and (age<=end_age):
            ids.append(i)
    return ids

name, age = read_info()
name, age = sort_info_by_age(name, age)

groups = [(Harry,23), (Sam,25), (Lisa, 29), (Mary,22)]


    #go trough age groups and write to file
    for start_age, end_age in groups:
        ids = get_ids_for_age_intervall(start_age, end_age, age)
        if ids:
            f.write("\n%i-%i\n" % (start_age, e

# Writing to a file
writeFile = open("user_names.txt","w")

writeFile.write("Harry\23")
writeFile.write("Sam\25")
writeFile.write("Lisa\29")
writefile.write("Mary\22")

writeFile.close()

readFile = open("user_names.txt")
print readFile.read()

# Open the file
movieFile = open("ml-latest-small/movies.csv")

# Initialize an empty genre dictionary
genreCountDictionary = {}


Exercise 3 - Reading from a file
Read and display the data from the file you had just written to.
Below are a set of recommended steps to accomplish this
open the file in read mode. This will return a handle to the file.
You can now iterate through each line in the file and then use readline to read each line.
Display each line as you read it in
Note that you can also use the read method to read in all lines or the readlines method to read all lines into a list.
In [18]:

def read_info():
     "Read info file"
    with open("info.txt", "r") as f:
        name, age = [], []
        for line in f.readlines():
            n, a  = line.strip().split(' ')
            name.append(n)
            age.append(int(a))
    return name, age

def sort_info_by_age(name, age):
    sorted_ids = sorted(range(len(age)), key=lambda k: float(age[k]))
    new_name = [name[i] for i in sorted_ids ]
    new_age = [age[i] for i in sorted_ids ]
    return new_name, new_age

def get_ids_for_age_intervall(start_age, end_age, ages):
    """get indexes for members in a given age intervall"""
    ids = []
    for i, age in  enumerate(ages):
        if (start_age<=age) and (age<=end_age):
            ids.append(i)
    return ids

name, age = read_info()
name, age = sort_info_by_age(name, age)

groups = [(Harry,23), (Sam,25), (Lisa, 29), (Mary,22)]

 END CODE
Exercise 4 - Finding the average age of users in a file
Write a python program to find the average age of users in the file you just created.
Below are a set of recommended steps to accomplish this
Open the file in read mode
Read in each line of the file
Split each line in the file to get the age
Find the average age and display it
In [19]:


class Student :
    def __init__(self, age):
        self._student.age = age
        self._marks = []
    
     Converts the student to a string .
      return The string representation .
    

     Sets the student's Age.
    
    def setStudentAge(self, age):
        self._studentage = age

    
     Gets the student's Age
      return the student's Age
    
    def getStudentAge(self, newAge):
        return self._newAge

    
     Appends a mark to the marks list
    
    def addMark(self, mark):
        self._marks.append(mark)

    def __repr__(self) :
         Build a string starting with the student Age
         followed by the details of each person age.
      s = "Student Age :" + self._studentAge + " "
        if len(self._marks) == 0 :
            s += " <none \n>"
        else :
            for mark in self._marks :
                s += " Course Module: " + mark.getModule() + " Raw Mark: " + str(mark.getRawMark())

        return s

    
     Method to calculate the students average age
    
    def calculateAverageAge(self):
        totalMarks = 0
        count = 0
        for mark in self._marks :
            if mark == 0 :
                count = count
            else :
                count = count + 1

            totalMarks = totalMarks + mark
            average = totalMarks / count

        return average



Exercise 5 - Appending to a file
Write a python program to append information provided by users to an existing file.
You will need to ask the user to enter their name, age, gender and profession using the raw_input method (for Python 3 users, you will use the input method).
open the file you just created in the above exercies in append mode and write this information to the file.
Remember to make sure that the information you append is entered in the same format where each field is separated by commas.
In [20]:

class Student :
    def_init_(name, age):
	User._name:
        self._Age = 
        self._gender =
	self._profession = 
    
     Converts the student to a string .
      return The string representation .
    

     Sets the student's Age.
      param newAge is the students.age.
    
    def setStudentAge(Name, Age):
        self._studentage = 25 

    
     Gets the student's gender.
      return the student's gender.
    
    def getStudentAge(gender, profession):
        return self._name

    
     Appends a mark to the marks list
    
    def addMark(name, age):
        self._marks.append(mark)

    def __repr__(self) :
         Build a string starting with the student ID
         followed by the details of each mark .
        s.age = "Student Name :" + self._studentId + "  "
        if len(self._marks) == 0 :
            s += " <none \n>"

if __name__== "__main__":
  main()

print("Student.name.age.gender.profession")
