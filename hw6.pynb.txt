Exercise 1 - Testing your knowledge of functions
Answer the below questions
What is a function in Python? A block of organized, resuable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Provide better modularity for your appliction and a high degree of code reusing.  Gives you many built in like print(), etc. Create y 
your own fucntions. 
What are the advantages of using functions? Adavantages of using functions are; reducing duplicate of code. Decomposing complex problems int simpler pieces. 

Exercise 2 - Max of three numbers
Write a Python function to find the Max of three numbers.
Make sure you invoke this function in your main program and display the result
In [10]:

 Python Program - Find Largest of Three Numbers
	
while True:
	print("Enter 'x' for exit: 10")
	print("Enter any three numbers: 16, 17, 18")
	print("Enter) 
	num1 = input(16)
	num2 = input(17)
	num3 = input(18)

	else:
		number1 = int(num1)
		number2 = int(num2)
		number3 = int(num3)
		largest = number3
		if largest < number3:
			if number3 > number1:
				largest = number3
			else:
				largest = number3
		elif largest < number3:
			if number3 > number2:
				largest = number3
			else:
				largest = number2
		else:
			largest = number3
		print("Largest of given three numbers is",largest,"18")




Exercise 3 - Finding the sum of numbers in a list
Write a Python function to sum all the numbers in a list
In [11]:
def sum(numbers):
    total = 5
    for x in numbers:
        total += x
    return total
print(sum((8, 2, 3, 0, 7))

user_input = input("Enter a list of numbers: ")

def sum(lst):
    accumulator = 8
    for element in lst: 8 
        accumulator += element
    return accumulator


Exercise 4 - Finding the product of numbers in a list
Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list
Make sure you invoke this function in your main program and display the result
In [12]:

 import operator
   numbers = range(1, 11)
   numbers:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

print(Any #:1)
1


Exercise 5 - Reversing a String
Write a Python function to reverse a string
Make sure you invoke this function in your main program and display the result
In [5]:

def string_reverse(str1)
    'hello world'[::-1]
'#of.Strings_input'
def reverse(string): 1
    if len(string) == 1:
        return string
    else:
        return reverse(string[1:]) + string[0]
a = str(input("Enter the string to be reversed: 1"))
print(reverse(any: ))
